# Examples of Beads programs

These are example programs in Beads that allow you to learn the program quickly.
The examples have an annotated code form (in markdown .md form), the raw source (.beads), and perhaps compiled versions (.html for browser, and .air for Adobe Adir Desktop format). 

## Example 1 - A simple analog clock, one of the shortest programs that actually does something useful

## Example 2 - A wristwatch simulation, another very short program that does some bitmap manipulation
