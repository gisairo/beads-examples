# Examples of Beads programs

These are example programs in Beads that allow you to learn the program quickly.
The examples have an annotated code form (in markdown .md form), the raw source (.beads), and perhaps compiled versions (.html for browser, and .air for Adobe Air Desktop format). 

## Example 1 - A simple analog clock, a tiny program that draws an analog clock
