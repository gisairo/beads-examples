## Programming examples

These are examples with specifications posted in this repository.
If you would like to try a pre-release version of the Beads compiler, visit us on Discord at https://discord.gg/pTAdsSW, and let us know if you are mac or windows (sorry no linux yet), what kind of apps you would like to build, and how many years of experience you have.

Beads is not a minor rehash of Python. It is a clean sheet design, carefully crafted to catch as many errors at compile time as possible so you spend less time debugging. These examples barely scratch the surface of the full range of Beads features, such as 
1. can run in reverse (time-travel-debugging) 
2. automatic refresh of screen areas when the underlying model changes, 
3. protected arithmetic like Excel, 
4. units of measure like 3 m + 2 ft, 
5. proportional layout system that responds to size changes beautifully, 
6. greatly simplified regular expressions, 
7. a simple and flexible module system 
8. no make system needed for most projects

### Example: Snake

The classic snake game as popularized by Nokia cellphones. Probably the most fun per line of code ever made. Program complexity rating: 500 words.

### Example: Sort method contest

The classic bubble sorting algorithm is pitted against the just slightly more complicated but a zillion times faster Quicksort amethod. Watch the two side by side sort the same number list, and see why Quicksort is so much more clever, by moving things larger distances. The larger the sample size the more terrible the bubble sort works. Program complexity rating: 440 words.

### Example: Analog clock

This simple program will draw a clock on the screen. This is among the shortest possible graphical programs one can imagine. Program complexity rating: 150 words.
