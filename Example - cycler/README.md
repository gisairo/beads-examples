### Cycler - a screen resolution animation tool

It is very important when designing for modern mobile devices to double check that your layouts look good no matter what the resolution and orientation is.

To that end we offer a handy tool, which functions like a debugger, where you run a program inside another program.  The cycler tool lets you see what your program would look like on a set of devices (which you can change of course).

You click the *run* button and you can then see it cycle through all the devices and after each round is completed, it toggles between landscape and portrait orientation.
